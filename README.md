# Nextjob Job Shop Control Software
The Nextjob Job Shop Control Software package is designed to aid the Shop Owner in managing the production control of their business.

History:

This project grew out of an application written for a small plating shop.  The main emphases for the original package:

Customers 
Parts and Processes
Order Entry
Shipping
Sales History

Accounting was handled by a separate package and an interface between the two systems was developed but never implemented.

As a hobby, development on the package has continued, but the modified application has never been put into production.
Hopefully someday the package will find an audience, in the meantime, continued development keeps the author out of the bar. 

Nextjob is writen in QMBasic and utilizes the QM Database system.  Information on QM can be found at:

The GUI development environment in which Nextjob runs in is called AccuTerm GUI. Information on Accuterm can be found at:
